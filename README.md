 File Sharing Web App on AWS – Cloud Computing Final Project
As part of our Cloud Computing course at the Faculty of Computer and Data Science, my team and I developed a simplified file sharing web application hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The goal was to allow users to upload and download files securely through a user-friendly web interface.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Key AWS Services Used
Amazon EC2 – to host the Node.js backend

Amazon S3 – to store uploaded files securely

IAM – for managing access permissions

VPC – for network isolation and security
-----------------------------------------------------------------
 Project Features
Deployed AWS infrastructure from scratch

Built a Node.js backend to handle file uploads

Allowed uploading of up to 10 files at once

Applied file type filtering for security

Stored files in S3 with unique filenames

Designed a responsive frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
-----------------------------------------------------------------
This project was a great opportunity to integrate cloud infrastructure with full-stack web development. We learned a lot about AWS services, backend APIs, and deployment best practices.
